# Sky Gradient

The current sky at a given location, rendered as a CSS gradient based on atmospheric physics. Refreshes every minute.

PHP port of the original JavaScript/TypeScript implementation by [Daniel Lazaro](https://github.com/dnlzro/horizon) (deployed at: https://sky.dlazaro.ca). 

IP geolocation feature removed for simplicity and privacy.

## Physics Implementation

- Correctly implements Rayleigh and Mie scattering with proper coefficients
- Includes ozone absorption layer modeling
- Uses appropriate scale heights for different atmospheric components
- Implements realistic phase functions for both scattering types
